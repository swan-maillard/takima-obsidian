During this milestone, we were asked the following objectives:
- Change all the endpoints to comply to REST architecture
- Create a custom Page Serializer to only send necessary data
- Get familiar with Jackson annotations
- Implement DTOs (for Request and Response) and their Mappers
- Use @JsonView to only send parts of the DTO according to the reached endpoint
- Create a custom ApiException and ExceptionHandling using @RestControllerAdvice
	- Send the stack trace in dev profile
 - Implement HATEOAS for resource creation, EntityModel and page links
 - Integrate the OpenAPI Swagger
