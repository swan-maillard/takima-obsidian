# ðŸ’  Monolithic

A **monolithic architecture** is a unified application where all functionalities are built and deployed together.

## 1. Core Characteristics:
- Single codebase and runtime process.
- All modules are tightly coupled.
- Typically backed by a single database.
- Deployment is simple and centralized.

## 2. Pros:
- Easy to start and understand.
- Simple deployment pipeline.
- Ideal for smaller teams and MVPs.

### 3. Cons:
- Hard to scale individual features.
- Tight coupling leads to technical debt over time.
- A single bug can affect the whole system.

## 4. Best Use Cases
- Internal tools.
- Proof-of-concept or MVP applications.
- Projects with short lifespans or low complexity.

# ðŸ’  Micro-services

**Micro-services architecture** decomposes a large application into a suite of small, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a single business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## 1. Core Characteristics:
- **Independently Deployable:** Each service can be built, tested, and deployed without affecting others.    
- **Loose Coupling:** Services communicate through well-defined APIs (usually over HTTP/REST, gRPC, or asynchronous messaging).
- **Polyglot Flexibility:** Teams can use different languages, frameworks, or databases best suited to the serviceâ€™s need.
- **Autonomous Data Ownership:** Each service manages its own database, eliminating direct cross-service data access.
- **Domain-Driven Design Alignment:** Services often map to business domains (bounded contexts) for better alignment with organizational structure.
- **Resilience Built-In:** Services are designed to fail gracefully and recover independently.
    
## 2. Communication Patterns:

#### Synchronous Communication
- **HTTP / REST APIs:** Common and easy to use, but adds latency and tighter coupling.
- **gRPC:** Fast, strongly typed, ideal for internal micro-service calls.

#### Asynchronous Communication
- **Message Brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS):**
    - Enables **event-driven architecture**.
    - Services publish/subscribe or use queues to decouple communication.
    - Ideal for workflows, audits, or reacting to changes without tightly coupling systems.

#### Orchestration with Temporal
- **Temporal (or Uber's Cadence)** provides a **durable workflow engine**:
    - Used to **orchestrate long-running business processes** across multiple services.
    - Handles retries, timeouts, and failures automatically.
    - Ideal for complex business logic, such as transaction workflows or multi-step job processing.

## 3. Pros:
- **Scalability:** Services can be scaled independently based on usage and load.
- **Autonomous Teams:** Teams can develop, test, and release services independently.
- **Fault Isolation:** Failures in one service donâ€™t cascade to others if isolation is enforced.
- **Technology Diversity:** Services can evolve with different technologies at their own pace.
- **Faster Iteration:** Enables CI/CD pipelines per service, accelerating delivery cycles.

## 4. Cons:
- **Operational Complexity:** Requires sophisticated CI/CD, observability (logs, metrics, tracing), and infrastructure tooling.
- **Distributed Debugging:** Failures may span across services; distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) is necessary.
- **Data Consistency Challenges:** No shared transactions across services; requires eventual consistency patterns.
- **Latency and Network Failures:** Remote calls introduce potential latency and failure points.
- **Orchestration vs. Choreography Confusion:** Complex workflows can lead to tangled responsibilities if not clearly designed.

## 5. Best Use Cases:
- **Large-scale platforms**: E-commerce (e.g., Amazon), media (e.g., Netflix), travel (e.g., Booking.com).
- **Multi-team collaboration**: Each team owns a service (domain-driven structure).
- **Systems requiring high availability and frequent deployment**: Deployments without downtime, with rollbacks and blue/green strategies.
- **Use of asynchronous workflows or streaming data pipelines**.

# ðŸ’  Modular Monolith

A **modular monolith** is a monolith that is designed with clear modular boundaries. It combines the simplicity of monoliths with the organizational structure of micro-services.

## 1. Core Characteristics:

- Code is organized into well-defined modules/packages.
    
- Each module has its own business logic and data boundaries.
    
- Still deployed as a single application.
    

## 2. Pros:

- Easier to refactor and test.
    
- Simplifies future transition to micro-services.
    
- Encourages separation of concerns without full distributed complexity.
    

## 3. Cons:

- Still shares a single point of failure (runtime).
    
- Requires discipline to avoid tight coupling between modules.
    

## 4. Best Use Cases:

- Growing applications preparing for micro-services.
    
- Teams who want structure but not complexity.
    
- Medium-sized products needing better maintainability.
