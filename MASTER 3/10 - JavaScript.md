# ðŸ’  JavaScript Core Concepts

JavaScript executes within a **runtime environment** that enriches the language with additional capabilities depending on the platformâ€”such as browser APIs (e.g., the DOM) or Node.js modules (e.g., file system access). The runtime consists of several key components:

- **Call Stack**: A data structure that keeps track of function calls and their execution order.
    
- **Heap**: A memory space used for storing objects and dynamic data.
    
- **Event Loop**: Coordinates asynchronous tasks by handling the execution of callbacks, promises, and other deferred operations.
    
- **Web APIs** (in browsers) or **Core Modules** (in Node.js): Provide essential asynchronous features like timers, HTTP requests, and DOM manipulation, enabling non-blocking operations.

# ðŸ’  ECMAScript

**ECMAScript** is the standardized specification that defines the core syntax, types, and behavior of JavaScript. Modern JavaScript development is guided by its evolving features.

Founded with **ES5**, got modernized with **ES6 (ES2015)**
### Key Features:
- **Lexical Scoping** with `let`, `const`, `var`
- **Arrow Functions** for cleaner syntax
- **Promises**, `async/await` for async handling
- **Modules** with `import/export`
- **Destructuring**, **spread/rest operators**
- **Optional chaining (`?.`)**, **nullish coalescing (`??`)**

# ðŸ’  DOM (Document Object Model)

DOM is the interface between JavaScript and the browser's rendered HTML.

### Core Concepts:
- **Selectors**: `getElementById`, `querySelector`
- **Event Handling**: `addEventListener`
- **DOM Manipulation**: `appendChild`, `innerHTML`, `classList`
- **Browser APIs**: `fetch`, `localStorage`, `History API`

# ðŸ’  Bundlers & Build Tools

Bundlers are essential tools in modern JavaScript development. They take your projectâ€™s source code (written in modules, often with newer syntax or multiple files) and **bundle** it into one or more optimized files for use in the browser or Node.js.

## 1. Why Bundlers Matter

Before bundlers, developers had to manage dozens of `<script>` tags or use older build systems. Bundlers solve key problems:

- Combine multiple files/modules into fewer files (typically one or a few).
- Transpile modern JS (ES6+) or TypeScript into backwards-compatible code.
- Minify and optimize assets (JS, CSS, images).
- Support hot module replacement (HMR) for faster development.
- Integrate tools like linters, preprocessors, or testing frameworks.

## 2. Common Tools:

- **Webpack**: Highly configurable, powerful ecosystem.
- **Vite**: Fast dev server with ES modules.
- **Rollup**: Great for libraries, tree-shaking focus.

# ðŸ’  TypeScript

**TypeScript** is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JS.

### Key Advantages:
- **Static Typing**: Catch errors at compile time.
- **Interfaces & Types**: Define shapes of data.
- **Enums**, **Generics**, **Decorators**
- **Tooling Support**: Autocompletion, refactoring, IntelliSense.

# ðŸ’  OPS (DevOps in JS World)

## 1. Tooling for Ops/Build:

- **NPM/Yarn**: Package managers.
- **ESLint**, **Prettier**: Linting and formatting.
- **Husky**: Adds git hooks like pre-commit

---

# ðŸ’  Testing

## 1. Frameworks:
- **Jest**: Unit and integration testing.
- **Vitest**: Fast Vite-based test runner.
- **Cypress**, **Playwright**: End-to-end browser testing.

# ðŸ’  Craftsmanship

- **Separation of concerns**: Clear layering (UI, logic, data).
- **Functional programming**: Prefer immutability, pure functions.
- **Modular code**: Small, reusable components.
- **Code reviews** and **pair programming**
- **Refactoring** regularly to keep tech debt low.
- **Design Patterns**: Observer, Module, Factory, etc.
