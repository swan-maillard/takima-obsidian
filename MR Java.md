## 🎓 Context
During this milestone, we were asked to:

- Install and understand **Maven**
- Compile and execute **jar and FAT jar** files
- Add **dependencies** to the project
	- SLF4J
	- postgreSQL
	- HikariCP
	- JUNIT
	- Mockito
- Connect the app to a **database** and use a **connection pool** to balance the load (HikariCP)
- Create **Article**, **Cart**, **CartArticle** and **Seller** entities
	- Override their **equals** and **hashCode** methods
	- Implement **Builder pattern**
	- Map them to their corresponding **database entities**
- Implement the **persistence layer** with **JDBC implementations** of their **DAO**
- Implement the **business layer** with their **service implementations****
- Implement **Unit Testing** with **JUnit** and **Mockito**
- **Release** the application

## 📝 Progress
I have produced the following bonus:
- Handle **Type-Safety** with **Currency** and **Country** enums
- Handle exceptions with custom **PersistenceException**
- Use **stream API** instead of classical loops when relevant

## 🤔 Difficulties
I haven't encountered notable difficulties.

## ✅ Note Sonarqube:
My project is currently 0 days in debt.
