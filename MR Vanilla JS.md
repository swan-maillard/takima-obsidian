	- **HTML Loader** to handle HTML imports
	- **CSS Loader** to handle CSS imports
	- **SCSS Loader** to handle SCSS files instead of CSS
- Rewrite the code using **ES6** standards
	- Convert **prototypes to classes**
	- Use **let and const** instead of **var**
	- Use **arrow functions** when possible
	- Use **template literals** instead of concatenation
	- Use **functional programming** when possible
